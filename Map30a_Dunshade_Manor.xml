    <description>A tall black iron fence overgrown with ivy encloses the Dunshade property, shutting out the Riverhaven streets that surround it.  Brittle leaves and dried yellow grass obscure what is left of a walkway.  The remnants of a long-abandoned child's playhouse sit forlornly in the corner of the lot.</description>

    <description>Nothing seems to be alive in this shadow-filled yard.  Large skeletal trees loom over the path, their dry brown leaves swirling and skittering in drifting patterns across the barren lawn.  The walkway's paving stones are broken or missing in random spots, and occasionally a large flat stone protrudes upright, as if it had been heaved up out of the ground.  A large two-story building squats at the end of the yard, the flared eaves of its tiled roof hanging over a wide front porch.</description>

    <description>Twisted brambles and thick spiney vines have enveloped the tall iron fence, creating a wall of prickly barbs that are topped by the fence's pointed spearheads.  The manor house looms over the side yard, pressing it up against the thorny wall.  Completely cut off from the light of day, even the withered brown grass has abandoned this part of the lawn.</description>

    <description>A colorful mosaic fountain stands in the center of a garden of trellised rhododendrons.  The flowers grow wild and abundant, but their once-brilliant colors have a sickly pale hue, and their leaves are mottled with brown spots.  Water still splashes into the basin of the fountain, adding a welcome melody to the gloomy atmosphere.</description>

    <description>A wide expanse of tall grasses and weeds grows here, apparently untended for years.  To the south the two-story manor house towers above you, abandoned and desolate, it's windows empty like the blank stare of a corpse.  The melodic sound of running water comes from the west, strangely soothing in this forsaken place.  You catch a glimpse of something white hidden in the grass.</description>

The air is strangely fresh and the room seems cared for by an unseen source.  A magnificent Elven carpet covers the hardwood floor, its colors only slightly dulled by age, and the walls of soft green silk hold torch sconces illuminating the opulent room.  An overstuffed burgundy leather chair faces a large portrait of the Dunshade family in a gilt frame.</description>

The festively handpainted black and white checkered floor is strewn with shattered bits of milk pitchers, wine jugs and mustard pots laying amongst bread baskets and dish towels.  A heavy marble-topped table lays on its side, and a lone unbroken vase rests against it holding a bunch of dried up sunflowers.  The only thing still in place is a wallboard holding a collection of bone-handled knives.</description>

A shallow alcove filling the far wall displays a painted mural of a large castle.  Black walnut chairs are placed haphazardly around the enormous carved table, as if their occupants had only just abandoned them in a rush.  This impression is emphasized by the place settings on the table that still contain dried-up, half-eaten servings of a meal.</description>

An unsettling silence hangs in the air, accompanied by a deep chill that cuts to the bone and turns breath to curlicues of frost.  Pale shafts of light from below cast the attic in deep, shifting shadows, creating the illusion that the tilting walls and jagged beams stretch almost endlessly north, vanishing into darkness.</description>

  <node id="49" name="Dunshade Manor, Middle of Attic">
    <description>This is the midpoint of the attic, but with the north and south ends lost in shadow and the ceiling timbers reeling like a dance of vertigo, it is impossible to tell whether distance and space hold any meaning in this cold realm.  Unfinished wooden partitions segregate a space to the west, where a boarded-up window once overlooked the lawns far below.</description>

  <node id="50" name="Dunshade Manor, West Window">
    <description>Illuminated by a pale shaft of light, a single row of heavy footprints track through the thick dust on the floorboards. They run from the southern stairs to a grimy window on the western wall, where they abruptly stop.  The floor inside the prints is spotless, near polished, as if the dust that covers everything else is afraid to mar the impression.</description>

  <node id="51" name="Dunshade Manor, Low Arch">
    <description>The ceiling rafters dip perilously low here as the roof veers straight down then back up again at a jagged angle.  The attic grows ever colder as one approaches the north end, and the silence of the room has become a near-tangible thing.</description>

  <node id="52" name="Dunshade Manor, North Attic">
    <description>Dust particles hang motionlessly in the frigid air at the north end of this long attic, where makeshift partitions were put up to create open storage spaces against the east and west walls.  What lurks there now is concealed by impenetrable shadow, appearing to writhe as if a blanket of snakes slither just beneath the blanket of darkness.</description>

    <description>A few broken chairs and a rusted-shut trunk are piled in the corner of this lonely alcove, coated by a layer of frozen dust.  Only the shadows move here, wavering mockingly at the edge of vision.</description>

    <description>Even in the thick of it, there is no way to break through the darkness pooled in this corner, with its cold shadows entwining like a whirlpool of pain and despair.  Dust coats the floor like a frozen river, a testament to the powers of time and decay.  The only exit is back to the west, just a little closer to the light.</description>

  <node id="55" name="Dunshade Manor, Storage Loft">
    <description>Moldy crates and discarded linens are piled along the narrow planks of this tiny loft, the rotted wood creaking underfoot and threatening to give way at any moment.  While an ice-coated ladder leads down to the relative safety of the attic floor, a precarious stretch of timber is unblocked enough to allow access to the north end of the loft -- if the footing holds.</description>

  <node id="56" name="Dunshade Manor, Edge of Loft">
    <description>Though it can't be more than ten feet above the attic floor, the unprotected edge of the loft seems to lean over a dizzying abyss.  A broken porcelain doll lies abandoned atop a jumble of rusted trunks, a sad reminder of the child who once played here.</description>

  <node id="57" name="Riverhaven, Crossroads" note="Map30_Riverhaven.xml">
    <description>Silvermoon Road meets Crescent Way in a small crossroads.  A tangle of back alleys and side roads wanders off behind the houses and shops of town.  The traffic here is fainter, almost nonexistent and the sounds of life seem oddly muted.  Passers-by seem more hurried and keep a warier eye out than you have seen along the main roads of town.</description>
