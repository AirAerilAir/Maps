    <description>The lanes outside the eastern gate of Riverhaven are crowded with the bustle of street peddlers and merchant wagons coming and going in a great rush to sell their wares.  Beggars line the paved road, aware that the more influential and wealthy folks use this gate.  They hover, hands extended, hoping that a moment of kindness and charity might befall them.  A stone bridge that once provided passage across the river is now little more than a crumbling stone pier used by some local fishermen.</description>
