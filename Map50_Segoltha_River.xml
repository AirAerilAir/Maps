The riverbank to the north is too steep to climb, as evidenced by the bits of torn cloth and slide marks that mar the muddy surface.  Below is the Selgotha river, its murky depths slightly calmer in this spot as the westward rushing currents slow to navigate the city-built embankment.</description>

  <node id="37" name="Segoltha River, Sandbar" note="Sandbar">
    <description>Secluded and safely out of reach of the swift-moving river, plants and animals seem to thrive here as evidenced by the extremely lush environs.  Young moss-covered trees are scattered haphazardly about, their strong roots taking advantage of the ideal conditions.</description>

  <node id="38" name="Segoltha River, Sandbar">
    <description>This little island is lush and teeming with life, but the sound of the rushing river engulfs even the most persistent of birds and insects.  A huge boulder takes up most of this area, rising from the sand like a miniature mountain.</description>

  <node id="39" name="Boulder, Base of Tree">
    <description>The large rock is clean and worn smooth by years of harsh weather and flooded banks, its only adornment a massive pine tree, seemingly growing out of the rock face itself.  A long, thick rope dangles from one of the massive branches above.</description>

  <node id="40" name="A Massive Pine Tree, Platform" note="Massive Pine Tree|Pine Tree|Platform">
    <description>Crude yet serviceable, a narrow platform has been built into the larger tree limbs.  A rocking chair sits precariously at one end, facing the panoramic view.  The tree continues to rise impossibly far above, providing ample shade while discouraging further exploration into its extensive heights.  One particularly narrow branch appears to lead further up -- but it would probably take a monkey to navigate it.</description>

  <node id="41" name="A Massive Pine Tree, Upper Branch">
    <description>The night sky is overwhelming in its closeness, the darkness like a blanket to anyone who is brave enough to venture upon the treetops.  The branch sways delicately in the breeze that sometimes whisks through the treetops.  The overpowering sound of falling pine needles, rustling vines and leaves emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings, the muffled sound of the rushing river a soothing background noise.  A flash of city lights sparkles in the distance.</description>
    <description>High up in the tree, hidden from the ground below by a layer of lichen and thickly intertwined vines is this somewhat precarious perch.  The branch, its leaves trembling perilously, sways delicately in the breeze that sometimes rustles through the treetops.  The view of the river is spectacular, its rushing water sparkling and swirling with a life of its own.</description>

    <description>The one remaining mast juts upward from the ruined deck, leaning at an angle as it rises above the surrounding forest.  Missing planks on the deck make the footing treacherous, and the gaps provide glimpses into the sand- and muck-filled holds below.  Anything of value has long since been stripped from the ship, leaving only weathered wood and scraps of rope and canvas.</description>

  <node id="43" name="Wreck, Near the Stern">
    <description>Protruding from the tilted decking, the shattered remnant of the mainmast dominates the area.  Little remains of the cordage and spars that once graced the mast except some bits and pieces of wood scattered about the deck.</description>

  <node id="44" name="Wreck, Stern">
    <description>Decking ends abruptly above the swirling water of the river as the stern of the ship drops off into the muddy brown waters of the Segoltha.  Broken planks and timbers give mute testimony to the power of the river.  Little remains of the name once emblazoned on the stern, only the faded letters CK and FI.</description>

  <node id="45" name="Wreck, Bow">
    <description>Directly below the bow, a large, gaping hole opens in the hull, vivid testimony to the reason the ship lies beached on the shore.  Mud and muck spills from the breach, from which weeds and vines clinging to the dirt climb up the exposed wood surface.  Little remains of the rigging and tackle, just bits and pieces of rope scattered on the planks of the deck.  The stump of a bowsprit points at the surrounding forest.</description>

  <node id="46" name="Wreck, Mast">
    <description>Only half the crow's nest remains, little more than a platform with rickety railings dangling precipitously above the forest canopy.  Rotten wood makes the footing dangerous, and holes in the decking give glimpses of the sheer drop to the wreck below.  Not far above the lookout post, the mast breaks off, trailing bits of rope and tackle that undulate in the slightest breeze.  Precarious handholds on the mast permit climbing back down to the wreck below.</description>
