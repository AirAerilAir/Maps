    <description>Mist wafts up from the depths of a deep gorge to hang thick and oppressive in the night air.  The steady drone of rushing water drowns out any forest sounds as it beats against the stone walls of the chasm and the boulders far below.  On the far side of the gorge a large rock juts up as a dark shadow sitting in wait on the edge of the precipice.</description>

    <description>If not for the constant sound of rushing water to reveal its presence in the gloom, it might be possible to unknowingly step from the edge of this deep chasm and fall into the inky blackness.  The trees of the nearby woods march like an army to the edge of the gorge.</description>
    <description>Time and rushing water have carved a deep gorge through the wilderness.  A heavy mist hangs in the air, proof of the passage of the rapids far below.  Frayed cords and a couple of clinging planks are all that remain of a suspension bridge that fell into rocky chasm.</description>

    <description>A thick mist hangs over all that remains of a once well-used path -- a few paving stones now broken, cracked, and thrusting from the ground at odd angles.  Constructed of an unusual dark stone, a temple emerges from the mist to loom up in defiance over the night-shrouded wilderness.  A stairway of black granite rises from the forest floor, ending at the entrance to the temple, which is carved in the semblance of a gaping serpentine mouth.</description>
    <description>All that remains of a once well-used path are a few paving stones -- now broken, cracked, and thrusting from the ground at odd angles.  Constructed of an unusual dark stone, a massive temple looms up in defiance over the surrounding wilderness.  The untamed forest closes in from all sides, trees reaching skyward as if to choke out the heavens.  A stairway of black granite rises from the forest floor, ending at the shadowed entrance, which is carved in the semblance of a gaping serpentine mouth.</description>

Iron torch sconces set in the walls provide no light, yet one can still make out the piles of leaves and debris that have blown in over time.  Granite benches have been placed on either side of an elaborately carved archway.  Two large serpentine incense burners, long since extinguished, still give off an exotic fragrance from a distant time.</description>

    <description>Wavering light produced by several glowing braziers offers enough illumination to make out discernible shapes.  A series of thirteen stone columns thrusts up from the black marble floor, the tops lost in the inky darkness high above.  Arrayed in a sweeping arc, these great columns stand like a ring of guardians, bringing focus to the high altar that rests upon a raised dais.  As if tended by unseen servants, this place of power has remained in pristine condition despite the passage of time.</description>

    <description>Years of accumulated dust rise slowly into the air, lending an unnatural quality to this neglected room.  Spanning the length of the chamber, a large wooden table stained with age and worn smooth still remains mostly intact.  Draped in a ghostly shroud of cobwebs, a chandelier hangs suspended over the center of the room, its light and warmth long ago extinguished.  The conversations and meals once held in this place are themselves spirits of the past, buried with the dead, never to be replayed again.</description>

    <description>The musty scent of ancient parchment and leather permeates this small room, giving one cause to wonder how long since another has walked these floors.  An unnatural chill fills the air, most likely never to be dispelled by the warmth of any mortal fire.  Cobwebs lie like lacy veils over many of the room's furnishings.  A finely embroidered tapestry hangs over the mantel of a small fireplace.  Strangely a hushed stillness lies over the room, nagging at the back of the mind.</description>

The purpose for this cramped cell can only be imagined, but the claw-like marks left behind by some poor creature suggest a horrific tale.</description>

Cold and dark, blackened iron torch sconces line the walls providing no comfort to this cramped passage.  Only the eerie echo of your every step breaks the tomblike silence.  At the north end of the hall an opening allows dim light from the outside to filter in.</description>

    <description>The darkness of the night is deepened by the shadow of the temple itself.  The once lush and exotic plants that flourished here have long ago succumbed to the parasitic weeds and fungus that now call the temple gardens their home.  Creepers and vines take on an otherworldly appearance in the deepening obscurity of night.  Stone statues, suffocating under the onslaught of the vines, raise their arms to the night skies, beseeching the gods for mercy from their inevitable fate.</description>

    <description>The forest clearing is devoid of life -- not a single plant, bird or insect can be heard or seen.  Rising in the center of the clearing is a small mound, atop which stands a structure made of polished black onyx, a darker shadow against the night sky.  Thirteen stones, distinct against the barren earth, make a rough staircase up to the entrance of a mausoleum.</description>

    <description>The stale air mixed with the scent of desiccated flesh is overpowering.  This corrupted odor, one that only the dead are wholly familiar with, threatens to leave living intruders gasping for breath.  Faint light barely penetrates into the structure, creating spectral shadows that dart about with every move.  Simple plaques, green with verdigris, are fitted to the capstones that line the walls.  A stray ray of light reflects upon a golden urn resting atop a serpentine pillar at the head of the chamber.</description>

Standing like a sentinel against the ravages of decay and time, a massive ironwood desk dominates the western wall.  Moldering black velveteen drapes, having failed in their task to shelter this room from the elements, hang in tatters about a stone archway leading out onto a balcony.</description>

If not for the comfort of the crumbling stone railing, the illusion of being enveloped by the night would be complete.  Exposed on the northern side of the temple, the balcony is buffeted by harsh chilling winds that whistle and moan through the slits in the railing.  Directly below, the faint outline of the gardens lurks.</description>

    <description>Along the far wall rests a large pile of bones, a discarded collection of broken and forgotten lives.  The sheer number of bones gives rise to wonder as to how many met their untimely end in the temple above.  A grinning skull dislodged from the pile stares up vacantly from the floor where it now rests.</description>

    <description>The burial vaults beyond, while simplistic in design, maintain an aura of venerable reverence.  An inlaid mosaic rimmed in strange, indecipherable symbols and sigils covers the floor of the chamber.  The absence of further trimmings does nothing but draw attention to the unusual pattern.</description>

    <description>This small sanctuary has been carved with meticulous care and remains uncharacteristically neat when compared to the state of the rest of the catacombs.  Three finely chiseled stone platforms, without any visible ornamentation, lie evenly spaced in the center of the room.  In each corner stands a single amphora.  The faint fragrance of chamomile still lingers in the air.</description>
