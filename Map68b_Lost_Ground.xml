    <description>There is barely a wagon's length of space between the massive ironwood plank door and the heavy iron grating of the portcullis covering the entrance.  Suspended from chains and worked by winches, the portcullis can be slid down vertical grooves in the stone to allow passage through the gate.  On the underside of the arched gateway is a mosaic made of broken shards of colored bottle glass.  It is an odd bit of beauty in an otherwise grim and desperate place.</description>

Once a popular gathering spot for the gossipmongers that previously inhabited the region, the crumbling brick and limestone structure now reeks with the stench of rotting flesh.  The overwhelming odor may even lead to the belief that it has been used as a repository for more than a few unfortunate souls.</description>
