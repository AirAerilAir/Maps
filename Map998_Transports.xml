    <description>In the middle of the ship, the main deck is closest to the water of all the open decks, and on a hard heel the waves can wash over the exposed planks.  For this reason, everything is securely fastened down to keep it from sliding or being washed away, and the hatches are tightly dogged shut.  Forward lies the forecastle and an oak door leading to the galley, while aft rises the quarterdeck and under it, a cabin door.</description>

    <description>Warmly lit day and night for the benefit of hungry sailors, the galley has food and drink available at all times.  On the starboard side stands a large oval pedestal table surrounded on three sides by a built-in bench, with cabinets and cubbyholes forming its sides and back wall.  To port is a long counter, behind which is the glowing hot black iron stove and a food storage area.</description>

    <description>Next to the door, the huge main-mast rises through the floor and pierces the ceiling.  A circle of hooks has been hammered into it, and various items of clothing and raingear dangle from them, swaying with the motion of the ship.  The rest of the large hold is filled with the crew's hammocks, slung between the framing poles and pillars.  Along the sides of the ship are large sea chests, unobtrusively bolted to the deck.</description>

Aft, the poop deck rises about eight feet above the level of the quarterdeck, and an ornately carved door leads to the captain's cabin, tucked under the higher deck.  A long bench curves along the port railing.</description>

    <description>The length of this ferry is filled to capacity with travelers making their way to the opposite bank of the Segoltha.  Several children kneel at the ferry's edge, watching the water lap gently against its side, while a group of Dwarven merchants glance longingly towards land.</description>

    <description>A few weary travelers lean against a railing at the bow of this ferry, anxiously waiting to reach the opposite bank.  An elderly S'Kra Mur stands alone at the stern, thoughtfully watching the shallow wake of the ferry shiver and become still.</description>

    <description>The southern bank of the Segoltha River presents a wide, flat flood plain far to the east and west.  The alluvial soil here is deep brown and fertile, nourished by the unpredictable rains that cause the river to rise rapidly and without warning.  Off in the distance to the south, you can spy the crests of trees.  This marks the boundary of the Endrus Forest, which surrounds the fabled Elven stronghold of Leth Deriel.</description>

    <description>Alfren's Ferry is a privately owned and operated ferry that carries folks over the broad and swift Segoltha River.  The ferry does a brisk business, since the trade route to the Elven forest reaches lies south across the river.  In the face of hostile assaults, the river serves as a formidable barrier.</description>

  <node id="46" name="Theren's Star, Deck">
    <description>The first of the massive barges to traverse Lake Gwenalion, Theren's Star still maintains a quiet elegance despite its apparent age.  The utilitarian deck upon which casual travelers walk is spartan, but the decking is made of expensive tabor wood felled from far southern forests.  An oval doorway leads down to the barge's cargo bay, while an elaborately-carved wooden door provides ingress to the comfortably appointed lounge.</description>

  <node id="47" name="Riverhaven, Pier" note="Map30_Riverhaven.xml">
    <description>Surrounded by surrealistic calm, this furthest edge of the pier stops almost a third of the way into the river.  Large, dark moorings stand like blackened sentinels at its edge, waiting for the arrival of the massive barges which service this port.</description>
    <description>A great throng of bodies hovers over bundles, piles and jumbles of cargo here at the furthest end of the pier.  The sole purpose of the cacophony is the readying and removal of shipments for the massive, sluggish barges which service the lake that stretches between Riverhaven and the northernmost areas of the province.  The intruding maelstrom of sights, sounds and smells is almost nauseating in its intensity.</description>

    <description>Nothing about this tattered replica of a wharf would instill confidence in the wary traveler.  Broken planks strafe the pier to which massive barges are tied on listing mooring rails which might tumble over at any moment.  The aged wood buckles easily beneath your feet, but apparently is tough enough to withstand the heavy cargo off-loaded each day.  Several bystanders mill about, checking their precious shipments as they wait for the next barge.</description>

    <description>A deep, peaty odor sifts through the wood in the belly of the barge, indicative of decades of contact with the murky waters of the lake.  Dark, damp and horribly cramped, the cargo bay is filled with crates, barrels, trunks and assorted parts needed for repairs.  A single hurricane lantern swings to and fro in time with the barge's movement.</description>

    <description>A dock extends from the stone roadway here, hanging out over a low-lying mountain road.  No water here, and certainly no ships, Hvaral's Dry Dock is serviced by barges pulled by somewhat strange looking beasts.  Outside the protection of the wall, arid mountain winds sting the faces of those who would dare to tarry in the open.  Officials in Therengia's blue and gold livery thoroughly inspect rows of crates and barrels that litter the dock, awaiting either import or export.</description>

    <description>A seemingly endless expanse of sand dunes stretch out to the north from the broad oasis, untouched apart from the deep channel worn in the ground by the barge route.  Pale scrub bushes strive for survival in this transitional environment, not entirely exposed to the harsh terrain while not quite safe among the lush greenery.</description>

    <description>The Suncatcher barge is made up of a wooden flatboat mounted atop steel rails.  An elevated platform at the front of the craft is used by the team of Sand Elves that sail it through the desert ocean by controlling the team of massive yeehars that pull it.  The barge itself is full of coils of rope, wooden crates and barrels, and bulging sackcloth.</description>

    <description>Low bushes and creeping vines stretch out along a downward slope from the oasis toward the desert wastes, accompanied by the dry husks of former vegetation that was not as successful.  A groove worn in the sand by the barge route skirts along the southern side of the tree line, halting the attempts of the small paradise to expand.</description>

    <description>Open windows allow cool air to circulate as the barge travels on the open lake.  Small, round tables bolted to the center floor are surrounded by cushioned bentwood chairs, while tiny booths of velvet upholstery line each side of the room.  A massive bar completes the decor, offering light snacks and beverages during the long journey.</description>

    <description>Rope Alley is a large room filled with rope tumblers.  Groups stand around the various tumblers shouting, cheering, and moaning as they watch the results of each tug.  Every inch of available space along the room's walls is filled with a rope tumbler.  A colorful banner reading "Fortune can be thine!" hangs at one end and a large sign sits in an easel by the exit.  Several well armed Gor'Togs patrol the area.</description>
