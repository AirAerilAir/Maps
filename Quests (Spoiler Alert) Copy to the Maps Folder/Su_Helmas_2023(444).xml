    <description>Yawning holes gape in the walls above piles of sandstone blocks and other debris.  Three piles of bones lie in a rough circle around a strange diagram on the floor.  Closer examination of the pattern is not possible, as no mortal eye can fully grasp the details, but one corner trails away in a line of chalk that implies that the working was never completed properly.</description>

A few containers remain intact by the small stove fitted into a corner, but the contents are a dried and congealed mass that is impossible to identify.  One sturdy table lies upended near the corridor, its top scorched and scarred as if it served as a last minute but futile barricade.</description>
