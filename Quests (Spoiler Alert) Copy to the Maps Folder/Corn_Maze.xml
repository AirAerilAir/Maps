    <description>The entrance to the corn maze sits on a small hill, surrounded by a two-plank wooden fence.  Songbirds regularly perch upon it, lending song to the air with their calls.

    <description>Standing at least eight feet tall, the huge stalks of corn appear fully ripe and sport numerous ears.  Several stalks have the leaves peeled back slightly and the bright yellow seeds showing, likely right on the cusp of needing to be harvested.  The growth looks quite healthy, making the walls of corn appear next to impossible to push through or see past.</description>

    <description>Dark corn stalks rise high on either side of the thoroughfare, at least eight feet tall and fully ripe.  The growth blocks out most of the night sky, only a sliver of it visible overhead.  The harvest in this area appears very dense, creating nearly solid walls that twist and turn in the darkness.</description>

    <description>The corn in this section of the cornfield seems sad and withered, with both the leaves and the stalks almost fully yellowed with only occasional streaks of green within them.  A large portion of the crop is partially bent over, tangled up with each other and unfit for both harvesting and consumption.  A large swath of corn is cut out of the field in a jagged line, likely to separate the diseased corner of the field from the otherwise healthy harvest.</description>

    <description>Stunted and blighted stalks of corn stand withered in the darkness, tangled up with each other in a maze of ruined and diseased crops.  A putrid smell comes from several of the struggling plants, and the vague outline of insects crawl on the ruined leaves, making them look eerily undead in the dim light.  Though the stalks are much shorter than other places in the field, the diseased and tangled nature of the walls makes crossing them impractical.</description>

    <description>Stunted and blighted stalks of corn stand withered in the darkness, tangled up with each other in a maze of ruined and diseased crops.  A putrid smell comes from several of the struggling plants, and the vague outline of insects crawl on the ruined leaves, making them look eerily undead in the dim light.  Though the stalks are much shorter than other places in the field, the diseased and tangled nature of the walls makes crossing them impractical.</description>

    <description>Stunted and blighted stalks of corn stand withered in the darkness, tangled up with each other in a maze of ruined and diseased crops.  A putrid smell comes from several of the struggling plants, and the vague outline of insects crawl on the ruined leaves, making them look eerily undead in the dim light.  Though the stalks are much shorter than other places in the field, the diseased and tangled nature of the walls makes crossing them impractical.</description>

    <description>A peaceful valley, sheltered by the surrounding hills, is laid out before you like a patchwork quilt of flowery meadows and neatly arranged farmland.  Centered in this multicolored vista is a small village.  You pause on the hilltop to enjoy this delightful view.  A meadowlark circles overhead for a moment, warbling its song to you, before swooping down toward the village, following the line of a well-traveled road.</description>
    <description>The moonlight reveals a small valley stretched out between the surrounding hills.  You can see a multitude of tiny lamplights twinkling in the darkness below, and faroff sounds of laughter and singing hover in the sweet evening air.  The faint outline of a road descends down into the night-cloaked valley.</description>
