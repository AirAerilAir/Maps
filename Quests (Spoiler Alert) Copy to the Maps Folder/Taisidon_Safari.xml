    <description>Carved deobar railings decorated with gilded waves line the deck.  Overhead an awning provides shelter for the crew to relax under.  The captain, who is sitting in an ebonwood chair inlaid with bits of shell and carved with flowers, watches five of the Halfling crewmen play a game of cards.  Hanging from the ship's wheel is a wine flask.  Forward access is provided by two walkways that lead around the main cabin.  The sound of waves provides a contrast to the calls of the crewmen.</description>

The jungle edges forward in what little sand remains, exposed roots recoiling from the salty water while quickly tacking in place any soil blown by the wind.  A felled durian tree, serving as a home for a few industrious sand crabs, lies across the path to a rocky point that extends into the churning surf.</description>

Angry water churns and thrashes against the craggy foundation of this stolid bastion, intermittently filling the air with salty spray.

    <description>An array of makeshift racks surround the bamboo walls, each displaying a variety of wares, lit by a trio of lanterns overhead.  A large threadbare rug covers the rough hewn plank flooring, while a faded tapestry decorates a far will with image of battling warriors.</description>

    <description>A cool seabreeze flows across the top of the tower, open to a brilliant view of the sparkling waters of the Jalren'rae'Taisidon lagoon on one side and the lush jungle of the island on the other.  Under an umbrella rests a blanket covered in a tropical flower print, on which rests goods for sale.  Sand covers the floor, ending at a blue-painted pool around a spiral stairway leading down into the tower.</description>

    <description>Blue glass lanterns hang in various lengths from the ceiling, each one with a slowly turning paper mobile around it, giving the light cast a flickering, watery effect.  Found objects are stacked around the curved walls -- tubes, bottles, and bowls -- all painted to resemble the various coral and creatures in a reef.  In one corner, some cavernous rocks frame steps leading further downwards into darkness.</description>

    <description>The air is cold here to the point where breathing becomes more of an effort.  Eerie green light oozes about the area, not quite illuminating large shadowy objects lurking just on the edge of its reach.  A rusted metal frame supports rotting driftwood in the most illuminated spot in the room, forming a table displaying wares for sale.</description>

    <description>Colorful batiks drape in loose swags from the rafters, clashing vividly with the purple and yellow painted walls and floors.  The tables containing the merchandise are daubed with large spots of colors over the bare wood of the furniture.  Gilt hooks on the walls hold glass lanterns that illuminate the room.</description>

    <description>The thatched ceiling rises high up above a smooth floor crafted from beautiful tropical hardwoods.  Benches, carved from the same woods as the floor, sit around the perimeter of the room.  Worktables are set around the room, allowing for alterers to work on their items.</description>
