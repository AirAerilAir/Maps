    <description>Like the maw of some great beast, the stalagmite and stalactite-filled cave's stone teeth are as sharp as time and nature can make them.  Beyond the cavern's gaping entrance, a forest of stone rises.  Yet, the pillars are coated in black ice, reminders of the spell that once kept this area frozen -- the area and its inhabitants, feared even by their creators.</description>

    <description>Body parts from all the races litter the bottom of this chasm.  For most of them it appears that this was where they died after a long fall and a terrible meeting with the hard stone floor.  Old blood stains the ground, and the sickening stench of decaying flesh fills the air, challenging even the strongest stomach.  The only way out is through a crumbling passage leading off to the east, or by climbing the towering chasm walls.</description>

    <description>Darkness fills this empty void as it sinks down into the frozen stone of the surrounding caves.  The chasm walls rise upwards around the small ledge that offers a brief respite from the harsh climb above and below.</description>

    <description>Water surges directly below a narrow stretch of stone that connects the cavern walls with a slender pillar of rock that rises up out of the glacial lake.  Although the bridge is made of the same dark stone that makes up the walls, none of the reassuring strength is apparent, and each step across it is a test of willpower.</description>

  <node id="49" name="Ice Caves, Rock Pillar">
    <description>Rising from the depths of the lake, this pillar overlooks much of the hollow mountain.  Waves slap against the slender base and spray from their crests makes the chill even more apparent.  A massive glacier is barely visible to the northeast as it slowly slips beneath the water's surface, and to the southwest, the vague outline of a bridge rises into the darkness.</description>
