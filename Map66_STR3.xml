Although it may just be wishful thinking, the crops growing in the fields adjacent to the shrine seem healthier than those farther away.  The line of trees to the north looms imposingly over the fields.</description>

    <description>The farmlands end abruptly at a line of trees, the demarcation of an old skyfruit orchard.  Those fields abutting the trees are scraggly and look as though they yield little come harvest time.  Skyfruit trees, while producing glorious, highly desired fruit, are notorious for stealing all the nutrients from the soil and requiring long, loving care for the fields to recover.</description>

    <description>Bright lights shine from the south, for Anloraten Crossing lies that direction.  Warm lights glow to the north, however, where an enormous oak ends the path.  No simple aged tree, this.  It's an oak that's broader than many a house, with branches as thick and sturdy as a S'lai Guard.  There's a sign attached to the oak, and an entryway that leads inside to many cheerfully raised voices and the welcome smell of homecooked food.</description>

A few Halfling children watch you discreetly as they create and manage a town several feet long, comprised of small pebbles, twigs and a devoured turkey leg.  One of the children winks so briefly that it might have been a joke shared among the light, the thin emerald shade and the two of you.</description>

Bare of decoration aside from an oil-burning lantern and a small stool, arrow slits slash the walls on all sides, allowing an archer an easy field of fire against invaders, whether outside the Clan or in the bailey.</description>

    <description>Battle standards, representing kin guilds and victories, hang from the plaster and beam ceiling that arches a full two stories overhead.  Brightly lit by torches placed at regular intervals along the walls, it is whispered that the floor was laid by Jainder Blackarm himself.  At the far end of the room, requiring visitors to walk the length of the hall to approach it, stands an immense chair.

The tall dark green grass moves slightly in a gentle breeze, providing the only sign of life in this otherwise still expanse.  Off to one side, a decaying kobold head sits atop a crudely carved post -- a sacrifice, perhaps, or a warning.</description>

    <description>Sinuous tendrils of dark purple mist swim through the air, entangling themselves in the deformed limbs of barren trees like ethereal serpents.  The dusky scent of nightshade carries over the moor.</description>
    <description>Sharp shadows cut through the landscape, accenting the twisted silhouettes of the grotesquely haggard trees while concealing the hazards that lie hidden within the patches of tall grass.</description>
    <description>Swaths of dark mist drape the moor in layers of shadow, concealing the source of a malignant rustling that waits in nearby tangles of nightshade.</description>
    <description>Tall grasses sway under the ebb and flow of the dark purple mists, kissing the verdant blades with icy dew.  Patches of colorful nightshade bloom amidst the grasses, a beautiful yet deadly addition to this dark, wild garden.</description>
    <description>Tendrils of blooming nightshade climb high through the dark mists into the vacant claw-like trees, appearing to give the deceased husks some semblance of life, however perverted.</description>
    <description>The dark mists cast a bluish-lavender pall through the air.  The motion of every shadow is magnified, twitching in wait just beyond your field of vision.</description>
    <description>The dusky scent of nightshade seems to manifest visually as the rolling, dark mists that are omnipresent over the wild moor.  The grasses waver in a lilting motion, enchanted by the intoxicating aroma.</description>
    <description>The soft mist makes everything seem muted and far away, disconnected and tinged with the illusion of a dream world.</description>

    <description>Irregular patches of tall grass and squat shrubs lie beneath a sinuous blanket of dark purple mist.  The twisted shadow of an occasional barren tree looms in the foggy distance.</description>
    <description>Sinuous tendrils of dark purple mist swim through the air, entangling themselves in the deformed limbs of barren trees like ethereal serpents.  The dusky scent of nightshade carries over the moor.</description>

    <description>Swaths of dark mist drape the moor in layers of shadow, concealing the source of a malignant rustling that waits in nearby tangles of nightshade.</description>
    <description>Tall grasses sway under the ebb and flow of the dark purple mists, kissing the verdant blades with icy dew.  Patches of colorful nightshade bloom amidst the grasses, a beautiful yet deadly addition to this dark, wild garden.</description>
    <description>Tendrils of blooming nightshade climb high through the dark mists into the vacant claw-like trees, appearing to give the deceased husks some semblance of life, however perverted.</description>

    <description>Radiant gaethzen orbs halo a statue of Ferdahl Kukalakai, positioned in the center of a cluster of lakeside villas so she can continue her eternal vigil over all of Ilithi.  The light casts a shadowed silhouette that stretches over the trees and lake, as if she was reaching for her lost home.</description>
    <description>Close to the path stands a lifesculpted statue of Ferdahl Kukalakai haloed by a ring of gaethzen orbs hovering from copperleaf tree branches.  She watches eternally over the tranquil waters of her city, a force for peace in death as she was in life.  The surrounding villas nestle in the iridescent sand along the lake as if taking comfort in her serene presence.</description>

    <description>The path cuts particularly close to the water as it traverses a grassy rise.  A large willow tree growing from the hill leans out over the lake.  The faint lighting from the gaethzen orbs causes the tree's slender branches to form tendrils of shadows that ooze across the lake's mirrored surface.</description>
    <description>A grass-covered rise on the shore supports a large willow tree that leans out over the waters.  Many years of erosion have taken their toll on the roots, but the drooping branches still manage to extend over the path as it cuts by the lake shore.  Small gaethzen orbs dangle between the rustling leaves like will-o'-the-wisps caught in a spider's web.</description>

    <description>Bright gaethzen orbs light the shore path, though the illumination ends before reaching a shadow-cloaked pier extending over the waters.  Carefully shielded by the surrounding foliage, a dim clearing contains a silverwood telescope mounted on a marble pedestal.  Nearby, the villas and their residents enjoy a grand view of the nightscape beyond the lake.</description>
    <description>The wide gravel path curves along the shore to end at a white crystalline pier that extends over the waters.  Smooth gaethzen orbs encircle a small clearing centered around a silverwood telescope mounted on a marble pedestal.

    <description>The ambient evening light seems to rain down a blooming waterfall of pale starflowers that grow on the walls of the house.  Light dances across the grassy garden from oil lanterns set along a stone balustrade, illuminating ornate stone benches set beneath arched trellises of twisted grapevines.</description>
    <description>The tall limestone and half-timbered walls of the house enclose three sides of the grassy cloister, while a stone balustrade twined with ivy borders the northern side.  Grotesque faces carved into the wooden corbels supporting the second story peer down amid the closed white starflowers creeping up the walls.  Stone benches inset with lead friezes sit below arched trellises of twisted grapevines.</description>

    <description>A section of wall here has been torn open, claw and tooth marks telling a vivid story along the broken wood boards.  A mess of feathers and chicken bones are concentrated here, and the nesting boxes and roosting structures nearby are smashed to splinters.  Further ahead, the lack of windows envelopes the end of the coop in darkness, which periodically flickers with yellow eyes and rumbling growls.</description>
