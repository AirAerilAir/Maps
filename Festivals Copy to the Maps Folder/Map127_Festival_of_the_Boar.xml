    <description>Clusters of hosta form a border at the edge of the thicker underbrush.  Their wide, deep green leaves are splotched with white, and in summer they send up tall shoots that bloom in decadent shades of purple and orange.  Occasionally, they rustle with movement, and a small grey coney or brown chipmunk emerges to see what visitors have come to its domain.</description>

    <description>The road is very narrow and uneven here, the forest leaning in from the sides and the craggy earth pushing up from below.  Gnarled tree roots snake through the stone-clotted soil close to the surface.  In places, they have been worn flat from years of accumulated foot traffic.</description>

    <description>Amid the lushness of the evergreen forest stands the skeletal frame of a dead bristlecone pine.  The pine's bare branches knock and scrape against each other with each breath of wind, sending down a shower of splintered wood.  The tree's dry, brittle bark clings to the trunk only in small ragged spots that are host to conferences of termites.</description>

    <description>The earth falls sharply downward from this perfect diving spot to dip its peaty edge in the river.  The bank leading to the river below is moist and fertile, making it an ideal home to a wide variety of hostas.  Most have variegated leaves of green streaked with yellow or gold, while others are nearly blue with blotchy patterns of white.  In spring, the leafy, low-growing plants send up tall spindly stalks that bloom in purple, white and orange.</description>

    <description>Here, the land is level with the water.  A permanent-looking puddle drenches the soil around the base of some tall cedar trees that cluster in a small depression.  Rain and snow feed the river that swells and ebbs with the seasons, changing the landscape and renewing the bank's fertile richness.  To the north and east, the earth rises again, pulling away from the sodden bank of the river.</description>

Clusters of the tree's small cones lie scattered about, most having been pried open by squirrels for the seeds within.  A few undoubtedly opened before they fell, allowing their seeds to disperse and begin the forest's next generation.</description>

    <description>Barely audible, the trickling of water whispers seductively from its unseen source.  Lush green vines armed with red thorns smother the eastern flank of the massive oak tree, yielding grudgingly to the grey moss swaying from the leafless limbs.  Rocky soils shows dark amidst scraggly patches of thin grass.</description>

    <description>Swirls and scuffs in the dust on the floor testify to vigorous action by large feet.  Deep gouges inflicted by heavy objects wielded with unimaginable strength scar the walls of what can only be a training ground.  Riddled with broken arrows, a target dummy is wedged into a tight corner.</description>

Animal carcasses are slung from rusty hooks embedded in the ceiling.  The floor is sticky underfoot, though it's hard to tell in the dim light whether spilled food or blood is the cause.  Low benches surround a long granite block that serves as a table.  Some sort of brownish crust speckles the top of the rough stone.</description>

    <description>The looming temple partly shadows the surface during the morning hours of the day.  Even when the sun gazes down fully upon Elanthia from its throne at midday, shadows manage to creep westward from some of the more prominent spires of the temple.  As day descends into night, though, the shadows hastily retreat into the mica-flecked granite of the mighty fortress, patiently waiting for the time to creep out into the world again.</description>

A tiny, faded ribbon that desperately clings to the twig holds a broken medallion fluttering in the moaning winds.

A single ice crystal has frozen just under the unicorn's eye, as if it were a tear of sadness from the avatar's goddess.</description>

    <description>Glossy with ice, the floor exudes a pressing cold that instantly penetrates clothing and goes bone deep.  Traces of banded carvings decorate the dark granite walls.  Rising at a steep grade, the floor has been shallowly scored to provide traction.  Most of the grooves have been worn smooth, either by the wind channeled through the tunnels or by the passage of others.</description>

    <description>Slumped on the ground like bloated corpses, some leather dummies rest amidst the grass and leaves.  The practice equipment rots and decays just like everything else exposed to the elements for years on end.  A family of enterprising rodents claims sanctuary in one of the torsos, and every now and then, beady eyes glint from the holes riddled through the fabric.</description>

    <description>Forgotten along with the rest of the clutter, a rusty rake lies adjacent to a tarnished pair of branch cutters.  From here, the view of the field through the goal posts reveals how nature is stealing the grounds slowly but surely.  Only the few gardening tools, relics of a past time, linger on the field as if to lie in wait for the elements to claim them, too.</description>

    <description>An upended wheelbarrow in the corner explains the excessive amount of dingy white chalk dust encrusted on the hedgerow and grass.  Too persistent to be washed away by rain or snow, the mixture must include some type of mortar or cement, likely the brainchild of a lazy landscaper who hated redrawing the lines on the field.  Unfortunately, a squirrel met his untimely demise while scampering through the stuff, as he now accents the area as a perfect plaster-cast statue.</description>

Deteriorating food scraps and empty bottles abound near a barrel tipped on its side, a gooey sludge leaking from the mouth like regurgitated bile.

The gravel fades into rugged brush grasses and spindly saplings, likely taking root in more recent years when constant activity in the area ceased.

Two walls are lined with hooks and cubbyholes, where togballers and the grounds crew could store their muddy gear.  Tattered bits of once-bright clothing and rotted muddy boots still remain, although the main occupants of the compartments now are a few weasels and a surly raccoon.</description>

Rusty rakes, shovels and the like stand at wobbly attention, but a few have fallen out of formation -- especially those where the wooden handles have completely given up the ghost.  Some bins in one corner may have held grass seed meant to fill in divots and bare spots on the field after a round of mayhem, although there is no real evidence of this, and they may have actually held turnips or rum for all the observer can tell.</description>

    <description>A high, dense hedgerow closes off the western and southern edges of this area.  The verdant field remains largely pristine in this remote corner the action rarely comes back here unless a particularly spry togball gets loose and attempts a dash for freedom.</description>

    <description>Shoots of brown grass tickle the sides of a grey stone well situated inside a partitioned yard.  The wooden support from over top the structure has collapsed to one side and now lies covered in soil and weeds.  Nowhere to be seen, the well's bucket must have been rescued for a better life elsewhere.</description>

    <description>Grass springs up around the wooden slats fencing in the area.  A few tree stumps, their bodies withered and moldy, disfigure the ground in one corner.  By the looks of things, they once were used as makeshift seating, and one has a cup-sized hole carved into the top.</description>

    <description>At first glance, the corner fence seems to have received a whitewash in order to improve and preserve the appearance.  However, closer inspection reveals layer upon layer of caked-on bird droppings.  The nearby hedgerow to the south shakes with activity, likely from the very avian miscreants responsible for decorating the planks.</description>

    <description>Huddled in the corner, a simple shack tilts slightly to its right, as if using the fence for support.  A tiny moon carved out of the waterlogged wooden door declares this as the field's outhouse, though the repugnant stench and residual brown muck seeping from the bottom are both key pieces of evidence for that conclusion.  Crude markings on the fence's railings illustrate the boredom and impatience of those forced to wait in line to use the facility.</description>
