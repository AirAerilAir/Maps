    <description>Overhead, sea plants woven into a mat spread from pillars of coral to provide shade for the visiting land folk.  Small glass and crystal globes hang from the pillars.  Underfoot, the smooth sandstone is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  Columns and domes rise up from the water surrounding the dock.  Cargo is being brought in by Merelew workers and then stacked on the dock for sorting.</description>
    <description>Overhead, glowing crystal globes shed a soft green-yellow light on the dock.  Tall coral pillars rise from the sandstone to provide anchorage for the awning overhead.  The smooth sandstone of the dock is decorated with coral, shells, and gold.  In the water, glowing points of light give a glimpse of the true Merelew city.  Soft breezes blow through the pillars, and in the darkness, the sound of the sea murmurs unchanged.</description>

    <description>Signs of hasty construction abound -- from the rough edges of the timbers to the occasional nailhead not sunk completely into the wood.  An awning has been erected on the west side of the extension, helping to shelter visitors from the setting sun while they await entry into the festival.  A small sign is tacked to one of the awning's poles, its painted lettering showing haste with the drips running down the front of the plank.</description>

    <description>Coral pillars rise from the sandstone of the dock to provide anchorage for a woven mat overhead.  The smooth sandstone slabs of the dock are decorated with interlocking circles made from corals, shells, and gold.  Crates soar in neat stacks, each labeled with the names of famous trading houses.  A few bear the seal of the Merelew, indicating that they are being shipped landside.  A group of Halflings moves cargo about.</description>
    <description>Coral pillars seem to twist upward in the soft green-yellow light of the crystal globes.  Underfoot, the dock is decorated with swirling patterns of coral, shell, and gold.  Neatly stacked in rows are boxes and bales of cargo.  Rising on the hill with the lights sparkling like gleaming gems in the night is the Merelew city, while gazing into the water more lights can be seen.</description>

Rising from the central cabin is the ship's tall ironwood mast, standing with sails furled.  Access aft is provided by a pair of narrow walkways leading around the cabin, while a locked deobar gate blocks further forward progress.

Maces and scimitars line the walls, along with multi-colored decorations for heroism.  A few also write reports, inspect cabinets for merchandise, and study a roster on the wall.  A Merelew guard captain looks on quietly, taking in all the activity without comment.</description>

Standing before the archway is a coral tree, shaped like a great deobar.  Under the branches are benches for people to stop and rest.  On both sides are fountains of sandstone decorated with coral.  The sounds of the water gurgling in the fountains and of the wind blowing through the tree can be heard.</description>
    <description>The road ends at a sandstone and coral archway.  Soft green-yellow light shed from crystal globes illuminates a coral tree in the middle of the road.

    <description>A curved spire constructed entirely from violet cinnabar dominates this arm of the starfish.  It has been carved into an endless, vermicular relief of stylized claws and dragons' heads.  Mummified arms and hands, swathed in indigo gauze, frame a diamond-shaped doorway.  A single lambent ruby occupies its summit, set in a wattled circular brass frame that resembles an eye.  Wide and round at its base and entryway, the spire swiftly narrows into a single, slender support that reaches for the sky.</description>

The pole is made of pink alabaster, carved to resemble three youthful tree trunks entwined into a single column.

    <description>Contained within the gargantuan iron sphere that forms this chamber are dozens of massive brass rings connected to a globe via a thick central axis.  Ceaselessly, the rings twirl and spin about in silent harmony, no two plotting the same course.  Prominently featured upon each is a limelight which collectively casts a multihued kaleidoscope of illumination about the room.  A particularly wide ring slowly plots a course that offers customers a relatively safe path between the entrance and exit of the shop proper.</description>

    <description>Subtle but bright lighting ensures that the clientele of this shop can properly appreciate the exquisite merchandise on offering.  Pale birch paneling along the walls adds to the general feeling of light and warmth.  Three display cases - trimmed in teak, ebony, and cherry - hold pride of place in the center of the salesfloor.</description>

    <description>The sounds of the festivities taking place outside are subdued and distorted here as they echo repeatedly off the cavernous stone walls.  A sloping tunnel descends further underground before curving back upwards.  From this vantage point, whatever lies at the end of the tunnel seems well lit as shadows are cast towards the inflection point.  A faint, sweet, and earthy scent lingers in the air.</description>

Every pair of pruning shears seems to have been soundly broken or disassembled, their pieces tossed wildly about with some blades even lodged into the walls.

    <description>Small puddles of water have formed throughout the area as the humidity forms condensation that drips from the walls and ceiling.  Some clever stonework successfully redirects much of the water into recessed, well-like structures carved into the walls.  Raised stone planters that once held plants, saplings and other specimens have been knocked from their pedestals, scattering soil -- now mud -- and dying plants alike.</description>
