    <description>A tall gate rises over a well-kept road.  Ironwood trees gather in patches around the steep city walls, their dark forms casting shadows over the thin brush.  The slender bows and branches that make the thick panels of the gateway into Leth curve and twist, their still-tender bark formed into a living arch by a lifesculptor's hand.</description>
    <description>Shadows of the night sky descend, their inky tendrils tugging at the stalwart wooden gate.  The path winds south away from Leth, into the most remote of the Deriels.  Behind the deobar barrier the city sleeps soundly.</description>

    <description>A tremulous throbbing fills the air, replete with murmurings from an unseen host, like pulsations from the heart of the impenetrable forest beyond the barrier of deobars that grow here.  Sympathetic vibrations, higher pitched, seem to emanate from the Sana'ati Dyaus at the town's center due northeast.  The living wall of trees has been recently fitted with a rattan and wicker gate that remains open night and day, leading out to a road winding south through the forest.</description>

    <description>A break in the living barricade forms a clearing that leads to the southwestern city gate.  Through it, all you see is forest beyond, lofty, silent and forbidding.  An old ranger, bowed and wizened, hobbles past, spewing a wad of some masticated greenish ooze directly across your path.</description>

    <description>A sudden snap in the deobars overhead is followed by soft, urgent footfalls along the arboreal platforms that circle the Elven stronghold.  You can barely hear the creak of a willow bow being drawn taut, ready to loose a well-aimed shaft at the heart of an enemy.  Not wishing to stay for target practice, you redouble your pace.</description>

Its hoary, drooping branches cascade down and the leaves tumble earthward like innumerable, brilliant green sparks from an Elothean fireworks display.  In an upper fork of the willow's massive trunk is a tall, thin structure.  With no apparent access from here, there must be some other way to approach the willow.</description>

You feel drawn back to the early ages of Elanthia, to the days of those ancient oracles in primitive times when the forest had a life unto itself.  Vows, oaths and prophecies were often uttered in the sheltered glades, canopied groves, the stone cromlechs and sacred precincts of the primeval woods.</description>

That eternal tree, whose beginnings are shrouded in mist, was the original Elven fortress around which the town grew.  In all the lore, among all the sacred Sana'ati trees that form the core of Elven settlements, Sana'ati Dyaus is perhaps the most fabled.</description>

Its limbs glow with a phosphorescent light and you can trace the very course of its roots by their faint glimmer.

Its trunk blocks out anything else you might have been able to see in that direction.  Merchants, traders, and other outsiders bent on commerce pass by, some headed to the bank just east, others headed to the trading post, shops and offices clustered in the area.</description>

They rail as though they would beat one another to the ground.  You can detect no creature in their foliage that would cause these violent movements.

A flash of tawny brown and a soft sighing from shadows close by reveal a sloe-eyed doe, dining contentedly on a feast of blackberries served up on thorny offshoots.  Behind the deer, several cloaked figures with aquiline features gather the ripe fruit.</description>

At the bottom of the hollow a sacred grove of bamboo marks the spot where ceremonies are conducted.</description>

    <description>The path verges on the eastern shore of Ilkas Veridun, the Mirror Lake, sacred to the Elven peoples of Elanthia.  Its waters are said to raise the dead, if used with a pure spirit and a right mind.  The surface is like glass, reflecting the sky and trees, with no ripples or bubbles breaking it.  Two streams lead out of the lake, one flowing north, the other east.  You cannot detect the source of all this water though.</description>

    <description>A small stream flows out of Ilkas Veridun eastwards, and disappears into the ground beneath a large tree.  A korrigan is said to haunt the sylvan spring here by night.  She lures unwary travelers to an enchanted castle far beneath the floor of Ilkas Veridun, or so the superstition goes, for a night of faery revelry.  At dawn, she turns into her true form, a hideous hag, and leaves her victims beside the path, most quite mad for life.</description>

Perhaps the strangest feature of the terrain is a large, out-of-place boulder that appears to cover a hole leading underground.</description>

    <description>Jutting out of the main trunk at a curious angle, this twisted branch seems to right itself as it ascends out of the mesh of other limbs and boughs until it pushes out southwest over thick brush.  Daylight streams down on a small patch of ground, unhindered because of the curious change in direction.  The drop from here would be precarious at best, but with a little work one might still be able to get down by scaling the trunk of the laurel.</description>

    <description>Judging by the marks in the dirt, many have made use of the ample space available in the forge yard to work on large projects, leaving behind only hoof prints and the deep scars of the horses' dragged burdens.  In emergency situations, this area likely has served as additional room to house troops or repair arms and armor, but for now, it sits unused.  Only the dust from the grinding rooms sweeps through the area on any regular basis.</description>

    <description>Left to rust in the one section of the forge open to the sky, several scrap metal bits of incomprehensible design lean against the wooden slats of the outer wall.  Some are combinations of basic geometric shapes, while others seem to be nothing more than large hunks of slag.  Here they lie, exposed to the ravages of wind and rain, ignoring the blatant sign proclaiming that all workers should dispose of unwanted materials appropriately.</description>

    <description>Unmistakably in a favorite location, the grindstone here has been kept routinely cleaned, revealing its white stone surface.  The reason for the preference is obvious with every breath.  Though the stifling heat that plagues the other areas of the forge is not absent here, a gentle draft manages to pull most of the aberrant dust out into the forge yard and away from panting workers slaving over the grindstone.</description>

    <description>All along the eaves, reed wind chimes and ornamental decorations jangle and dance, bouncing gently off one another.  With every breeze, the soft clinks and jingles of the noisemakers rise in subtle crescendo, playing counterpoint with the steady pounding of hammer on steel in other sections of the forge.</description>

    <description>Resembling little more than extravagant walk-in chimneys, the smithies of Leth Deriel's renowned forge works are smartly crafted with fluted stones to direct smoke and ash upward.  Though free of smoky obstruction, the air is still hot enough to induce instant beads of sweat on exposed flesh.  Presumably, the vents near the roof that release the gaseous by-products of heated metal and burning wood are too far above to make for an equal respite from temperature.</description>

    <description>A constant sibilant sound of hissing stirs the chamber, augmented in orchestral fashion by the odd low pops of heat and the high-pitched whistle of outside breezes.  Grey streamers of smoke flutter upward from a reinforced forge, ascending like a pack of drab butterflies to freedom through the vents in the roof.</description>

    <description>Arranged neatly in this cramped area is a good assortment of the tools of the trade.  A steel anvil awaits every new blow of the hammer, its horn polished by either a tidy hand or regular use.  Standing half the height of the chimney-like room, a stone forge melds flawlessly with the back wall.  Lines of soot and dust trail upward in little spirals along the wall, the only remains of the smoke and ash from the forge's previous use.</description>

    <description>Beneath the cover of the high, sloped roof, the grindstones have been used for years, spouting layer upon layer of dust in a triangular spray against the walls and ground.  Often, a miscreant burst of wind will suck away some of residue, sending it into the forge yard as short swirls of choking filth.  Luckily, the area is not left just for the wind to clean, and the ground is scraped by the marks of shovel and broom.</description>

    <description>The sounds of work in the other sections of the forge echo through the walls of this area, reverberating even over the noisy spinning of grindstones.  Since this space is bordered on two sides by stone walls -- one being the back of the forge area -- the ringing tones of metal on metal bounce noisily, clashing with the rasping grindstones, and creating a distorted cacophony of sound.</description>

Potted plants ring the area, their lush foliage sectioning off the area from the bustling square beyond.

    <description>The sounds of Bosque Deriel and Leth Deriel further on are muted by the suddenly dense woods.  The brush-choked pathway makes its way further east, eventually opening up into a wide clearing.  Wooden bridges link some of the trees here, likely for the town's scouting guardsmen and hunters alike.  Crates of tools and supplies are nestled amongst the creeping vines and other undergrowth of the forest.</description>

    <description>From time to time, the sounds of a team of woodsmen can be heard as they carefully choose and fell another of the forest's elder trees.  The pruning serves dual purposes -- to supply the needs of nearby Leth Deriel as well as to renew the woods with younger, stouter growth.  The small clearing here allows travelers and workers alike a brief respite from the day's duties while the stone-encircled firepit provides food, light, and warmth during the colder months.</description>

    <description>In this small corner of the clearing, a giant mound of boulders and rocks dominates the setting.  A majestic weave of different vines has been coaxed into covering most to soften their surfaces.  The weaving doesn't appear entirely natural, even for delicate Elven hands, but rather as if enhanced by a Nature Binder's skilled magical training.  One of the flat, rocky surfaces was left exposed, and small tools and trinkets are frequently left for others in need.</description>
