    <description>A faint trail fades to nothing more than a thin break in the undergrowth, but seems to faintly curve east to southwest.  The heavy brush scratches and whips any exposed skin with each step forward.  An occasional rustle from areas unseen is a soft reminder that the solitude of the area is only an illusion.</description>
    <description>Though deep, the darkness isn't complete and the chirring sounds of insects fills the air.  Pressing in all around, a thicket of scrub and brush make passage difficult.  What little light there is comes from the east.  All other directions stare back with an opaque blackness as thick as tar.</description>

    <description>You come upon a small clearing in the heavy woods that allows a view of the sky.  A faint path can be made out that wanders into the trees, but it fades off before you can wonder about where it might lead.  There is an unnerving quiet here, even the wind seems to have died.  You feel a stranger in this wild place, perhaps an unwelcome stranger.</description>

    <description>Tangled underbrush creates a thick lattice here, and moving through it is like wading against the current in a cold stream.  The barest motion sends thin branches biting into skin.  Tiny tufts of fur snagged on undergrowth show that two-legged creatures aren't the only ones caught by surprise.</description>

    <description>A lively brook once bubbled through the narrow gully, but time and drought have left only this cracked streambed as a reminder.  A few straggling weeds poke up through flakes of rock-hard dried mud.  Several courses of ancient stone line both banks, showing the hand of one who wished to control the wanderings of nature.</description>
