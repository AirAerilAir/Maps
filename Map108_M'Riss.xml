    <description>A runoff parallels the road for a short way before cutting a sharp angle away and then down toward the ocean.  Wagon tracks, ruts, and hoof prints marr the ground where the ditch carves a path across the road, the cause of many a stumble.  The tiny crevice vanishes into the gaping maw of a large cloven boulder that sits askew, striking the pose of a slack jawed fool drunk after too many drinks.</description>

The construction is good, but woefully unlikely that it would stop a speeding horseman from plummeting into the deep gorge.  Indeed, several of the posts are split from some unknown collision.</description>

    <description>Tilted on its side, the skeleton of a plow sits alone in the overgrown fields.  Seasons of absent farmers have aided the weeds and shrubbery in their slow takeover of the plow's corpse.  A complete fence still encircles the out of control growth in the field, but its days of functional service have long since passed.  Where the wood slats have not fallen from neglect, garden spiders have virtually covered it with sticky webs.</description>

    <description>Fishing poles, nets and signs proclaiming sales on bait are clear clues that this minuscule village's survival depended on the fishing trade.  Only a handful of homes still stand after so much time exposed to the elements without upkeep, and the doors on most swing open in the sea breeze.  A pier, some distance to the south, juts out into the sea, desperately attempting to escape whatever memories it holds of this deserted village.</description>

    <description>Soft mud underfoot, not to mention the occasional ankle-deep pool, shows that the river is lower than usual.  But from the sound of flowing water, the Altanen is still wide and powerful.</description>
    <description>The water level in the Altanen has dropped, exposing a nearly flat strip of muddy bank.  To the west, a long streak of green is visible in the middle of the river, and there seems to be movement on it.</description>

The eastern channel must be deeper, for its water is relatively smooth and unruffled, but in the western arm the lowering of the river has uncovered jagged rocks, and the water foams and races between them with a loud roar.</description>

A leaf drifts down, taking a long time to fall, slowed in its descent by the rising bog gasses that clog and taint the air.</description>

    <description>This room, the largest by far, has the feeling of a long-abandoned campsite about it, one left in a hurry.  On the upward sloping floor lie rusted buckles, cooking pots, a lantern -- even a good-luck charm perhaps cast off in disgust.  Time and sediment have frozen them all where they fell.  Some effort was made to pile the gear near the walls, leaving the center clear of the worst of the clutter.</description>

    <description>A niche, a little above the level of the main chamber, is the driest spot in the cave, and from its vantage the whole room below is visible.  It sits empty, silent, almost waiting.  Some nameless bygone visitor left only one trace: from one of the walls, a bundle of papers juts out, wedged tightly into a crack.</description>
